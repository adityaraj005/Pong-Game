# Pong Game

This project is a classic Pong game developed using Python's Turtle module. The game includes features such as paddle movement, ball collision detection, and a scoring system.

## Features

- **Paddle Movement**: Control the paddles using keyboard inputs.
- **Ball Collision Detection**: The ball bounces off the paddles and walls.
- **Scoring System**: Keeps track of the score and ends the game when a player reaches 10 points.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language.
- **Turtle Module**: Used for creating graphics and game elements.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/adityaraj005/Pong-Game.git
   ```
   
## Navigate to the Project Directory:
   cd Pong-Game

## Run the Game:
   python main.py

## Code Structure
  main.py: The main game logic.
  paddle.py: Contains the Paddle1 and Paddle2 classes for paddle movement.
  ball.py: Contains the Ball class for ball movement and collision detection.
  dash.py: Contains the Dash class for drawing the dashed line in the middle.
  scoreboard.py: Contains the Scoreboard class for keeping track of the score.
  
## Key Learnings
  -**Game Development**: Learned to develop a classic game using Pythonâ€™s Turtle module.
  -**Collision Detection**: Implemented collision detection for game elements.
  -**Modular Code Structure**: Organized code into separate classes for better maintainability and reusability.
